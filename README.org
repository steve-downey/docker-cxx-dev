* A base Dockerfile for C++ compilation and testing

This produces a base image with current versions of GCC and Clang suitable for building C++ projects.

It is intended as a base image for projects.

Currently provides, by default, gcc 12 and clang 14 with all associated tools, current CMake, ninja, and the build essential.

It is intended for building projects, not for deployment.

It is also not intended to host development, other than the build/test cycle.


You probably shouldn't use it. Find or build a base image you trust.
